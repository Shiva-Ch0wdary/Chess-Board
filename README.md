# Chess Possible Moves Calculator

This project is a chess game feature that calculates and highlights all possible legal moves for a selected chess piece. It also highlights enemy pieces in red if they can be captured. The project is developed in **Unity 2020.3.X** and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, focusing on clean code and maintainability.

## **Features**
- **Highlight Legal Moves:** When a chess piece is selected, all the valid moves are highlighted.
- **Enemy Capture Highlighting:** If an enemy piece is within the range of a pieceâ€™s move, it is highlighted in red.
- **No Movement Logic:** This project only handles the highlighting of possible moves; actual piece movement logic is not implemented.
- **Helper Functions:** The project uses helper functions to manage chessboard tile retrieval and highlight functionality.
